# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Black and Red Roulette

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Program that simulates very basic black and red roulette.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will allow the user to bet fake money on black, red, even, odd, and first-third dozen in roulette and keep track of their winnings. Along with this, it will include a roulette wheel to visualize the process. This will be executed using multiple functions with different purposes. One function to spin the roulette wheel, another to prompt the user to make a bet, another to keep track of the earnings, etc.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

* Not applicable *

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Working solo

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I hope to accomplish a simple roulette game where the betting works and winnings are tracked.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be everything I listed above + a fully functional and visually appealing roulette wheel.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to accomplish everything I listed above.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I believe that this class has taught me most of the skills I will need to code a functional black and red roulette simulator, although I am sure I am going to have to look things up and refresh my knowledge on certain topics. A new skill I may need to acquire is pygame for the roulette wheel. Since I am working alone, I will do everything myself.
